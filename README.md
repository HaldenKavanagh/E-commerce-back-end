## Demo video

My 10 video limit in screencastify has been reached, so i used OBS to capture my screen instead. In the videos folder (videos\walkthrough-video.remuxed.mp4), there is a mp4 file wich is a full walkthrough demo of my app's backend functionality. The file is too large to be played on the github website. You can however view the video in vscode if cloned. I am attatching the demo video in my assignment submission as well.
